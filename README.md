# Chat Room Website (PictoChat Clone)
## About
A chatroom website using websocket connections that is heavily inspired by PictoChat for the Nintendo DS.

## Features
- Direct connection via websockets for a live messaging app feel
- Chats aren't stored to a database
- Contacts selection, allowing for easy direct connections to online users

*This is still a work in progress, and this readme will be updated as I think of more features*
